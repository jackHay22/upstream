## Info
- Game made by Jack Hay using Clojure. Started in Dublin, Ireland in 2018.
- For more information, read the docs

## App build info
- To build upstream.app: ``` ./build.sh ``` (requires ``` lein ```, ``` javapackager ```)
- For container server mode: ``` ./build.sh -server ``` (broken) (requires ``` lein ```, ``` docker ```)
- If build script fails to install lein, install [lein](https://leiningen.org/#install).

## Docker
- Raspberry pi use: ``` FROM hypriot/rpi-java ```
- Note: there is currently a problem running app in container.  I am currently trying to use an X11 server for graphics.

## Resource Specifications
- Fullscreen resource resolution is 350x200 (all resources are scaled based on java max window calculation)
